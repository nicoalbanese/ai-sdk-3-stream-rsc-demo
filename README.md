This is a very simple working example of Vercel's new streaming RSCs feature in AI SDK 3.0.

## Getting Started

First, install dependences.

Second, create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project and add your OpenAI key: `OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key`.

Finally, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
